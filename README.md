# Time Value of Money

## Purpose

Time value of money states that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.

There is Future Values (FV) and Present Values(PV) of money. We will look at both

For FV, we will look at:
- Lump sums
- Non-annual compounding
- Continous compounding - stated and effective rates
- Equal and unequal cash flows

For PV, we will look at:
- Lump sum,
- Non-annual compounding
- Equal cash flows (annuities) and unequal cash flows
- PV if time is not indexed to today (i.e. t does not equal 0)
